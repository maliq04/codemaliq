# Test Blog Post

This is a test blog post created from the admin panel. It demonstrates the local blog functionality.

## Features

- Full CRUD operations through admin panel
- Statistics tracking (views, likes, comments, shares)
- Category filtering

## Content

This post should appear on the blog page and be fully functional with all the features of dev.to posts.

### Testing

When you click on this post from the blog list, it should:

1. Navigate to the correct URL
2. Display the full content
3. Show proper metadata
4. Track views and other statistics

That's it! This is a working local blog post.
